UI Design Tips

Keep it Simple: Avoid overwhelming the player with too many options. Keep the design minimalistic and intuitive.

Consistency: Use consistent fonts, colors, and icons across the entire game.

Feedback and Transitions: Ensure smooth transitions between questions and provide feedback when the player answers correctly or incorrectly (could be subtle animations or a pop-up).

Mobile Optimization: Ensure the design works well on mobile devices, especially since trivia games are often played on smartphones.
